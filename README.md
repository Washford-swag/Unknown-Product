# Nav - Route Navigator

## Overview
**Route Navigator** is an intelligent digital route assistant designed to help commuters confidently navigate public transportation systems in Nigeria. It eliminates confusion during transit by providing real-time guidance, AI-assisted conversations, and visual maps — transforming uncertainty into clarity.

## The Discovery

### The “Unknown Product” Concept
The idea behind Route Navigator emerged from exploring the **“unknown product”** — an **unseen need** for guidance and clarity during transit. Commuters often rely on strangers for navigation, asking questions like:
> “Where can I board the next bus?” or “Where should I drop?”

This social habit highlights a **dependence on others for direction**, especially in unfamiliar environments.  
Route Navigator replaces that dependency with a **personal digital guide** that provides:
- Real-time navigation assistance  
- Visual route maps  
- AI-powered conversational support  

It transforms **the unknown journey into a known path**, allowing users to make informed decisions about where to board, alight, and navigate confidently.

## The Problem

Navigating public transportation in Nigeria is often complex and frustrating, particularly for:
- Foreigners and tourists  
- New residents  
- Locals unfamiliar with specific routes  

### Key Challenges
- Lack of centralized and up-to-date transit information  
- Inconsistent bus routes and stop naming  
- Difficulty identifying correct boarding points and alighting stops  
- Limited access to real-time updates and fare estimates  

These challenges lead to **delays, confusion, stress, and safety risks** for millions of commuters daily.

## The Solution: Route Assistance System

**Route Navigator** introduces an **intelligent Route Assistance System** — a smart, context-aware companion that guides users through every step of their journey.

This system bridges the gap between **digital navigation** and **real-world public transport**, ensuring users feel both **informed and supported** throughout their trip.

## The Reflection

Interpreting **“The Unknown Product”** was initially challenging. It seemed like a product that already existed but wasn’t yet recognized — an abstract idea. However, deeper exploration revealed it as an **unseen need** — a pain point users experience daily but rarely express.

### Key Insights
- Commuters subconsciously rely on strangers for transit guidance.  
- This human behavior signals a **gap in digital navigation solutions**.  
- Route Navigator fills this gap by turning subconscious needs into a structured digital experience.  

### Personal Takeaway

As a Product Manager:
> “Clarity is something you build, not something you wait for.”

Through defining the problem, challenging assumptions, and trusting the discovery process, I learned how to transform uncertainty into an **innovation-driven opportunity**.

## Summary
**Route Navigator** redefines the way commuters experience public transport by:
- Providing **AI-based, human-like guidance**
